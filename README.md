# IT-Ticket-Playbook

A collection of step-by-step troubleshooting writeups for common IT support issues.
Each ticket documents real symptoms, triage steps, commands, root cause analysis, and verification.



## Ticket Format

Every ticket follows this structure:

1. **Symptom** - What the user reported or what you observed
2. **Fast Triage Questions** - What to ask or check first
3. **Commands + Output Analysis** - What to run and what the results mean
4. **Decision Tree** - If X then Y logic for diagnosis
5. **Fix** - The actual resolution steps
6. **Verification** - How to confirm the fix worked
